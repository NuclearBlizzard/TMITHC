 ITA_prepare_for_case_e:0 "Prepare for Case E"
 ITA_prepare_for_case_e_desc:0 "Case E (short for emergenza, 'emergency') is the series of government operations first outlined by the Duce in 1949 in case of his death or incapacitation. Case E describes a sweeping reform of the PNF, the governing fascists, to allow young policymakers and administrators to replace the old guard. Mussolini, ever distrustful of rivals, prefers to see his old comrade Cesare Maria de Vecchi to succeed him as Duce."
 ITA_reinstate_the_gran_consiglio:0 "Reinstate the Gran Consiglio"
 ITA_reinstate_the_gran_consiglio_desc:0 "The Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, the 'Grand Council of Fascism', was the highest governing body of fascist Italy that assisted the Duce in his daily duties between the 1920s and the early 1950s, when, in 1952, it was dissolved by Benito Mussolini along with all national government, replacing central institutions with confederate regions reporting directly to the Duce. Now, we might want the Grand Council back."
 ITA_choose_a_successor:0 "Choose a Successor"
 ITA_choose_a_successor_desc:0 "The Duce is dead! All that is left of his greatness is a testament that dedicates Cesare Maria de Vecchi as his successor as leader of fascism, the PNF, and the glorious Italian Empire. What is left of Vecchi however is a lot of bad blood with the regional administrators as well as the Spanish government, who would not appreciate him as dictator."
 ITA_the_former_traitor_pietro_nenni:0 "The former Traitor: Pietro Nenni"
 ITA_the_former_traitor_pietro_nenni_desc:0 "In a rather ambitious if not crazy plan, Mussolini's son-in-law has presented a South Italian administrator and former political prisoner and socialist as a potential Prime Minister with restricted powers: Pietro Nenni is highly popular with the Italian people and very unpopular with the Germans. His inauguration would be a restart of the Italian economy and a great insult to both De Vecchi and Berlin."

 ITA_rivitalizzazione:0 "Rivitalizzazione"
 ITA_rivitalizzazione_desc:0 "Nenni, even after joining the PNF, never fully abandoned leftism. In Calabria, he kept employment and even work safety of dock workers in Taranto and other cities in mind, causing dismay among capitalists but pleasing the workers. As leader, he has a plan of "Rivitalizzazione", 'revitalization', to get the economy running. The corporatists warn that his welfare and spending plans scream of communism."
 ITA_legacy_of_the_psi:0 "Legacy of the PSI"
 ITA_legacy_of_the_psi_desc:0 "As part of the social liberalizations that Nenni aspires to, the PNF's grip on educational primacy must be revised and replaced with a system more in line with the Italian enlightenment thinkers of old. The people need to be reminded that, just like Nenni, the late Duce was once part of the PSI, the Italian Socialist Party. These old values aren't as hostile to Italy as they were led to believe in the past 30 years."

 ITA_the_western_motorways_desc:0 "A long promised infrastructural improvement, the Western Motorways were the late Duce's idea during the late 40s and early 50s, inspired by the German Autobahn system to advance Italian overland connection. The initial plans got bogged down by funding shortages and the increased priority given to the eastern routes in the former Yugoslavia. Nenni holds it vital to get Savoy connected to the rest of Italy."

 ITA_legalize_labor_unions_desc:0 "One of the central plans outlined by Pietro Nenni to increase economic output was to raise wages for the working class through the relegalization of labor unions. This allows the proletarians to go on strike independently and fight for higher wages from their employers without the need of government assistance. The state will keep itself backdoors however, to prevent for example labor strikes during war."

A veteran of World War 1 and advocate for Italy's war heroes, he was Commander General of the Blackshirts and is the last living original Quadrumvir who assisted Mussolini in the March on Rome. De Vecchi is now 76 and uncomfortably friendly to the Germans, but he represents the original fascism. There must always be a Duce."
